# Basis Grotesque Mono Pro assets

Place your licensed `Basis Grotesque Mono Pro` webfont files here so the site can self-host them. The `index.html` stylesheet currently looks for:

- `BasisGrotesqueMonoPro-Regular.woff2`
- `BasisGrotesqueMonoPro-Medium.woff2`
- `BasisGrotesqueMonoPro-Bold.woff2`

Keep these filenames (or update the `@font-face` entries) so the new font loads correctly. Once the files are present, Vite will serve them at `/fonts/...`.
